# Arduino-wine-cellar-controller

## About
This is my Arduino "Hobby project" controlling a wine cellar door using the web.

How does arduino do this,
It's a mini web server (Not complete) hosting a website.
I can repsonde to custom rest-api calls.

The rest calls lets you tell the arudino to toggle on or off the relays
Also get sensor data values to do dynamic updating.

## Platform 

IDE Visual code, But should be simple to move to atom or other IDE
Also used Platform IO plugin. 

## Hardware used the arduino 
* Arduino Mega 2560
* Arduino Ethernet shield
* HTU21D Humidity Sensor
* Micro SD card
* 2 relay switches 
* Custom built clamp sensor

## Disclamer 

There should be unit tests in this code. Using this code is done on your own risk!
